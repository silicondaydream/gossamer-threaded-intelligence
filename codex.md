# Arboria Research
At Arboria Research, we specialize in the development and study of swarm intelligence, distributed systems, and their applications for micro and macro autonomous robotics. Our research explores the intricate dynamics of collective intelligence, aiming to design robust, scalable systems capable of executing complex tasks autonomously across interstellar scales. From theoretical frameworks to practical simulations, our work seeks to enable groundbreaking applications such as planetary-scale transformations, Dyson swarm harvesting, and resilient distributed networks for space exploration and habitation. With a multidisciplinary approach combining AI, robotics, and astrophysics, we aim to pioneer the future of intelligent systems and their role in humanity’s expansion into the cosmos.

It all starts with Gossamer


# Gossamer Threaded Intelligence

Gossamer Threaded Intelligence is a suite of proprietary algorithms that facilitate “threaded intelligence,” enabling decentralized agents to share insights and coordinate decisions with minimal overhead.

Gossamer Threaded Intelligence (Algorithm Suite)

Goal: Library of swarm intelligence(SI) algorithms, communication protocols, agent behavior logic. Should be easily integrable with Leviathan (or other simulators) and allow rapid prototyping of new algorithms.

Language Strategy: Primarily Python for ease of experimentation, leveraging its rich ecosystem for AI/complex systems. Performance-critical components could potentially be implemented in C++ and exposed via Python bindings if profiling reveals bottlenecks, but start with pure Python.

Deployment Strategy: Python library installed locally (e.g., pip install .) within virtual environments. Can be containerized alongside Leviathan for specific simulation runs.

Python:
Core Numerics: NumPy
Graph/Networks: NetworkX (Useful for modeling communication topologies)
Data Handling: Pandas (For analyzing results/parameters)
Optimization: SciPy.optimize (Contains standard optimizers)
Machine Learning (Optional): scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (If exploring ML-hybrid approaches)
Testing: pytest
Packaging: setuptools (setup.py or pyproject.toml)

# Steps to develop the project

1. Project Initialization
           • Define packaging (setup.py/pyproject.toml)
           • Pin core dependencies (NumPy, NetworkX, Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn) in requirements.txt
           • Add .gitignore, README.md and LICENSE
        2. Package Structure
           • Create top-level package `gossamer`
           • Subpackages:
             – agents/ (base_agent, simple_boid, task_oriented_agent, heterogeneous types)
             – algorithms/ (coordination, optimization, navigation, resilience)
             – communication/ (base_protocol, broadcast, gossip)
             – decision_making/ (voting_mechanisms)
             – environment/ (perception)
             – interfaces/ (leviathan_interface)
             – utils/ (metrics, other helpers)

## In-House Novel/Proprietary Tools

1. **Leviathan Engine** SEPARATE REPO: A cutting-edge simulation framework designed to model and optimize the behaviors of massive swarms operating in distributed environments, from planetary surfaces to interstellar voids.
2. **Gossamer Threaded Intelligence**: A proprietary algorithm suite for “threaded intelligence,” enabling seamless communication and decision-making across distributed autonomous agents.
3. **Maneuver.Map** SEPARATE REPO: A real-time visualization and control platform for swarm dynamics, offering unprecedented insights into multi-agent interactions, energy efficiency, and emergent behavior patterns.


### Key Integration Points:

## Leviathan -> Gossamer: Leviathan will need a mechanism (likely via its Python bindings) to load and instantiate agent logic defined in the Gossamer library. The Gossamer agent code will interact with Leviathan through a defined API (exposed via bindings) to get sensor data, agent state, and execute actions (e.g., agent.sense(), agent.move()). This is handled by the gossamer/interfaces/leviathan_interface.py module.

## Leviathan -> Maneuver.Map: Leviathan's data_logger module should output simulation state (agent positions, energy, status, etc.) in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON lines, Feather/Parquet for efficiency). Maneuver.Map's backend (data_processor.py) will read these files (or potentially connect to a live stream/database if needed later) and prepare the data for the frontend.

## Maneuver.Map Backend <-> Frontend: The backend serves the frontend code and provides data via REST API endpoints and/or WebSockets for real-time updates.

This structure provides modularity, leverages appropriate technologies for performance and ease of development, incorporates the needed extensions, and should be manageable for a small, capable team. Remember to start simple within each module and build out complexity as needed.
